# GitHub Final Project – Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that computes **simple interest** given:
- Principal amount
- Annual rate of interest
- Time period (in years)

---

## Formula

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times T \times R
\]

---

## Inputs

- **P** — Principal amount  
- **T** — Time period (in years)  
- **R** — Annual rate of interest  

---

## Output

- **Simple Interest** — calculated as `P × T × R`
